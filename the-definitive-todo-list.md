## At home

- [x] User Interface
  - [ ] Make the interface work
  - [x] Skin Cancer
    - [x] Let the user take a photo with their phone
    - [x] Process the image with the best performing model
    - [x] Display the results
    - [x] Host on github pages
  - [x] Alzheimer's
    - [x] Make the local version work
  - [ ] Make a guide on how to use the UI

- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning
	- [ ] Use a grid search
	- [ ] Use a random search
	- [ ] Look more into hyperparameter tuning and model optimisation

## On campus

- [x] Finish the automated testing library
  - [x] Write some examples for the library
- [ ] The Report
  - [ ] Document the different hyperparameter tuning
  - [ ] Document the different ways of testing the model and showing its performance
  - [x] Talk about the web interface and it's potential uses
- [ ] Talk about different metrics
  - [ ] Sensitivity/recall
  - [ ] Specificity
  - [ ] Precision
  - [ ] F1 Score



## Markscheme Checklist


- [ ] Critical analysis and Discussion (10%): A discussion of actual project achievements and how successful the project was. Clear evidence of reflection on the project process, its difficulties, successes and future enhancements. Any conclusions or results analysed or discussed appropriately;
- [ ] Technical Decision-Making (10%): Are important (technical) decisions well made and argued? This includes good design decisions, choice or development of algorithms, scope of the project.
- [ ] Structure and Presentation (20%): Good use of English. Clear and appropriate report structure. Nice use of figures.
  - More graphs are needed
  - Go over everything to ensure there aren't mistakes and everything is clear
- [x] Contents and Knowledge (20%): Description of relevant theory - whether mathematical, algorithmic, hardware or software oriented. Also adequate chapters on development and Software Engineering;
- [x] Bibliography and Citations (5%): Clear and appropriate bibliography with good citations. Must be clear and well formatted.
  - Bibtex has taken care of this
- [x] Professional issues (10%): Should be a topic relevant to the project undertaken.
  -  I feel as though I have covered this well

- [x] Rationale (10%): Aims, objectives and a good introduction describing the structure of the report.
  - Added a rationale section, needs more objectives
- [x] Literature Review and Background Reading (15%): Description and critical analysis of relevant background material from books, research papers or the web. Analysis of existing systems that solve similar tasks;

## The Code

 - [x] Does it work? Is it stable?
 - [x] Is the software usable? Is the interface appropriate for the application (a compiler might require more technical skills to run than an e-commerce site)?
   - Add the Venv to the report instructions
   - Clearly explain how to run each of the python files, step by step
   - set the env variables for the directories to the datasets  
 - [ ] Does the code and system structure follow the design?
   - Not sure about design, maybe do a block diagram with draw.io
 - [ ] How complete is the functionality with respect to the requirements?
 - [x] Is the coding clean and well documented?
   - Need to refactor
 - [x] Does the GitLab repository reflect the use of good software engineering principles including appropriate use of branches/tags?
 - [x] Does the product require techniques, tools, theory or concepts which are clearly above second year level?
 - [x] Does the product use complex new technologies/platforms or require the study of a significant body of literature from disparate sources to complete?
