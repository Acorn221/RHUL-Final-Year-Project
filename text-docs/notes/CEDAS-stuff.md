## Project Aims

Compare the performance of pruning algorithms on a range of different models.

## Moticvations

There are many algorithms for pruning neural networks, but it is not clear which is best for which model. This project aims to compare the performance of a range of pruning algorithms on a range of different models to help determine which is best for which model and which is best overall.

## Deliverables

- A report detailing the results of the experiments.
  - How I've setup the models and the transfer learning.
  - This should include a table of the results of the error rates over time with the pruning algorithms, for each pretrained model
