  abstract = {Background: The determination of brain volumes using visual ratings is associated with an inherently low accuracy for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A support-vector machine (SVM) is one of the machine learning techniques, which may be utilized as a classifier for various classification problems. This study exploratorily investigated the accuracy of SVM classification models for AD subjects using brain volume and various clinical data as features.Methods: The study was designed as a retrospective chart review. A total of 201 eligible subjects were recruited from the Memory Clinic at Siriraj Hospital, Thailand. Eighteen cases were excluded due to incomplete MRI data. Subjects were randomly assigned to a training group (AD = 46, normal = 46) and testing group (AD = 45, normal = 46) for SVM modeling and validation, respectively. The results in terms of accuracy and a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis are reported.Results: The highest accuracy for brain volumetry (62.64%) was found using the hippocampus as a single feature. A combination of clinical parameters as features provided accuracy ranging between 83 and 90%. However, a combination of brain volumetry and clinical parameters as features to the SVM models did not improve the accuracy of the result.Conclusions: In our study, the use of brain volumetry as SVM features provided low classification accuracy with the highest accuracy of 62.64% using the hippocampus volume alone. In contrast, the use of clinical parameters [Thai mental state examination score, controlled oral word association tests (animals; and letters K, S, and P), learning memory, clock-drawing test, and construction-praxis] as features for SVM models provided good accuracy between 83 and 90%.}

abstract = {A large number of papers have introduced novel machine learning and feature extraction methods for automatic classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, while the vast majority of these works use the public dataset ADNI for evaluation, they are difficult to reproduce because different key components of the validation are often not readily available. These components include selected participants and input data, image preprocessing and cross-validation procedures. The performance of the different approaches is also difficult to compare objectively. In particular, it is often difficult to assess which part of the method (e.g. preprocessing, feature extraction or classification algorithms) provides a real improvement, if any. In the present paper, we propose a framework for reproducible and objective classification experiments in AD using three publicly available datasets (ADNI, AIBL and OASIS). The framework comprises: i) automatic conversion of the three datasets into a standard format (BIDS); ii) a modular set of preprocessing pipelines, feature extraction and classification methods, together with an evaluation framework, that provide a baseline for benchmarking the different components. We demonstrate the use of the framework for a large-scale evaluation on 1960 participants using T1 MRI and FDG PET data. In this evaluation, we assess the influence of different modalities, preprocessing, feature types (regional or voxel-based features), classifiers, training set sizes and datasets. Performances were in line with the state-of-the-art. FDG PET outperformed T1 MRI for all classification tasks. No difference in performance was found for the use of different atlases, image smoothing, partial volume correction of FDG PET images, or feature type. Linear SVM and L2-logistic regression resulted in similar performance and both outperformed random forests. The classification performance increased along with the number of subjects used for training. Classifiers trained on ADNI generalized well to AIBL and OASIS. All the code of the framework and the experiments is publicly available: general-purpose tools have been integrated into the Clinica software (www.clinica.run) and the paper-specific code is available at: https://gitlab.icm-institute.org/aramislab/AD-ML.}

abstract={The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

ABSTRACT={Carcinogenicity testing plays an essential role in identifying carcinogens in environmental chemistry and drug development. However, it is a time-consuming and label-intensive process to evaluate the carcinogenic potency with conventional 2-years rodent animal studies. Thus, there is an urgent need for alternative approaches to providing reliable and robust assessments on carcinogenicity. In this study, we proposed a DeepCarc model to predict carcinogenicity for small molecules using deep learning-based model-level representations. The DeepCarc Model was developed using a data set of 692 compounds and evaluated on a test set containing 171 compounds in the National Center for Toxicological Research liver cancer database (NCTRlcdb). As a result, the proposed DeepCarc model yielded a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.432 for the test set, outperforming four advanced deep learning (DL) powered quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models with an average improvement rate of 37%. Furthermore, the DeepCarc model was also employed to screen the carcinogenicity potential of the compounds from both DrugBank and Tox21. Altogether, the proposed DeepCarc model could serve as an early detection tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TingLi2016/DeepCarc" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://github.com/TingLi2016/DeepCarc</ext-link>) for carcinogenicity assessment.}

              amyloid-beta (A$\beta$) may initiate or potentiate pathologic
              processes in Alzheimer's disease. Lecanemab, a humanized IgG1
              monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to A$\beta$
              soluble protofibrils, is being tested in persons with early
              Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: We conducted an 18-month,
              multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial involving persons 50 to
              90 years of age with early Alzheimer's disease (mild cognitive
              impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease) with
              evidence of amyloid on positron-emission tomography (PET) or by
              cerebrospinal fluid testing. Participants were randomly assigned
              in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous lecanemab (10 mg per
              kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks) or placebo. The primary
              end point was the change from baseline at 18 months in the score
              on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB; range, 0 to
              18, with higher scores indicating greater impairment). Key
              secondary end points were the change in amyloid burden on PET,
              the score on the 14-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's
              Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog14; range, 0 to 90; higher
              scores indicate greater impairment), the Alzheimer's Disease
              Composite Score (ADCOMS; range, 0 to 1.97; higher scores indicate
              greater impairment), and the score on the Alzheimer's Disease
              Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild
              Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL; range, 0 to 53; lower scores
              indicate greater impairment). RESULTS: A total of 1795
              participants were enrolled, with 898 assigned to receive
              lecanemab and 897 to receive placebo. The mean CDR-SB score at
              baseline was approximately 3.2 in both groups. The adjusted
              least-squares mean change from baseline at 18 months was 1.21
              with lecanemab and 1.66 with placebo (difference, -0.45; 95\%
              confidence interval [CI], -0.67 to -0.23; P<0.001). In a substudy
              involving 698 participants, there were greater reductions in
              brain amyloid burden with lecanemab than with placebo
              (difference, -59.1 centiloids; 95\% CI, -62.6 to -55.6). Other
              mean differences between the two groups in the change from
              baseline favoring lecanemab were as follows: for the ADAS-cog14
              score, -1.44 (95\% CI, -2.27 to -0.61; P<0.001); for the ADCOMS,
              -0.050 (95\% CI, -0.074 to -0.027; P<0.001); and for the
              ADCS-MCI-ADL score, 2.0 (95\% CI, 1.2 to 2.8; P<0.001). Lecanemab
              resulted in infusion-related reactions in 26.4\% of the
              participants and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema
              or effusions in 12.6\%. CONCLUSIONS: Lecanemab reduced markers of
              amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease and resulted in moderately
              less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo
              at 18 months but was associated with adverse events. Longer
              trials are warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of
              lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease. (Funded by Eisai and
