# This is my project diary

## 19/10/2022

Today I have been deciding the specific classes of images I want to use for my project.
I had initially intended on using only 1 class, however I have decided to use 2 classes instead as I think it will be more interesting to see the results of the pruning on 2 classes rather than 1,
It will also demonstrate better the different strengths and weaknesses of the individual pruning methods.

I have decided to use the following sets of images:

	[Flowers Dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz)

	This dataset is likely to be an easier dataset for the models to get high accuracy on, as the different flowers are quite distinct from each other.

	[Alzheimer's Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uraninjo/augmented-alzheimer-mri-dataset)

	This dataset is going to be more difficult for the models as the changes are more subtle between the different scan images, and the images are not as distinct from each other.
