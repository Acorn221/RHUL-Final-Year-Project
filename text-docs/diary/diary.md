# This is my project diary

## 19/10/2022

Today I have been deciding the specific classes of images I want to use for my project.
I had initially intended on using only 1 class, however I have decided to use 2 classes instead as I think it will be more interesting to see the results of the pruning on 2 classes rather than 1,
It will also demonstrate better the different strengths and weaknesses of the individual pruning methods.
