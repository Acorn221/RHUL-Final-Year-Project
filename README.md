# RHUL Final Year Project

This was my final year project for my BSc in Computer Science, which achived a first for the report and the code.

It used transfer learning of image classification models to help classify Alzheimers in the OASIS dataset, and skin cancer in a bespoke dataset from [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2019.105725)
